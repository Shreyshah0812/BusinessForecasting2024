##Looking at Insurance data since 2002 gives us a really long view of how Quotes value has changed over the years. We can see if there's been more or less Quotes overall, we can use all the data

#Hypothesize if the dataset has trend, seasonality, or both.
#Trend: The trend component indicates a general rise and fall pattern over time, with some long-term increases and decreases.
#Seasonality: The seasonal component shows regular fluctuations that repeat at a constant frequency, suggesting a recurring seasonal effect.

acf(Insurance_ts)
#Verify using Acf
#From the Acf plot we understand that plot has many spikes at various lags, which confirms the  autocorrelation and presence of both trend and seasonlity.


decomposed_ts <- stl(Insurance_ts, s.window = "periodic")

#Verify using decomposition
#The Trend component shows the overall direction or progression of values over time, capturing long-term patterns. The Seasonal component reflects repeating cycles or patterns within specific intervals, like monthly or yearly fluctuations.

#Chose an accuracy measure
#for choosing the accuracy we will chose all the 5 accuracy measure studied in class that are RMSE,MAPE,MAE,MPE,ME

# I am choosing RMSE

#Create a forecast model for the next 12 months. Include Naive, Average, Exponential Smoothing, HoltWinters, and Decomposition (both types).

#Our forecasts are based on a lot of data from the past 8 years, which helps us see both long-term trends and yearly patterns. We used several different forecasting methods to get a good idea of what might happen. Our tests show that the forecasts are accurate and reliable. 

#Make sure you provide an interpretation in simple terms (so a layperson can understand) of what each forecast model is telling you. 

##naive Model
#If there were a certain number of Quotes last month, the simplest guess for next month is the same number.

## mean model
#If you don't see any clear trends or patterns in the data, it's okay to just assume that the number of Quotes will stay about the same.

##Exponential Smoothing (ETS) Forecast
#This forecast looks at whether the number of Quotes has been more or less recently. It's good for when there's a clear trend.

##Holt-Winters Forecast
#This forecast looks at both the overall trend and the more and less values of quotes thathappen at certain times of the year,
