#Is the time series seasonal? 
#ANS:  Yes Time series is seasonal

#Is the decomposition additive or multiplicative?
# ANS:  The decomposition seems to be additive. Because, with as trend increases, we do not see any increase in the seasonality. The seasonality appears to be the same throughout.

#If seasonal, what are the values of the seasonal monthly indices?

#For which month is the time series value high, and for which month is it low?

#ANS:  High value from the time series is June 2022 with the value 17.967(in millons) and the low value from the time series is May 2023 with the value 8.944(in millons)

#Can you think of the reason behind the high and low values in those months? 
 
#Car sales are influenced by a variety of economic, seasonal, and market factors. When the economy is strong, with factors like tax refunds, end-of-quarter sales, or holiday promotions, car sales tend to increase. Conversely, economic uncertainty, such as inflation, rising interest rates, or supply chain issues, can lead to decreased sales. Additionally, seasonal factors like post-holiday spending or unfavorable weather can impact consumer behavior. However, new car launches, government incentives, or improving economic conditions can help stabilize and boost sales. These factors combined shape the dynamic nature of the automotive market.

#The chart shows car sales over time from 2022 to 2024, with the black line representing actual sales and the red line depicting a smoothed trend, likely a moving average or modeled estimate. Sales remain relatively stable in 2022 but experience a significant decline around mid-2023, likely due to economic or market disruptions. The red line smooths these fluctuations, showing a gradual drop during 2023 and a recovery towards 2024. By late 2023, sales stabilize, and the red trend line closely follows the actual data. This visualization highlights both short-term variability and long-term patterns in car sales.

#What is the value of alpha?  What does that value signify?
#The value of alpha is 0.0018.Alpha is the smoothing parameter for the level component. A low value of alpha indicates that the model gives more weight to past data and less weight to recent observations for estimating the level.

#What is the value of beta? What does that value signify?
#The value of beta is 0.0001.Beta is the smoothing parameter for the trend component. A very low beta suggests that the trend is stable over time and changes very slowly

#What is the value of gamma? What does that value signify?
#The value of gamma is 0.9982.Gamma is the smoothing parameter for the seasonal component. A high gamma value indicates that the seasonal component adapts quickly to changes in seasonality.

#What is the value of initial states for the level, trend, and seasonality? What do  these values signify?
#Initial state values:
#Level (l): 18.7948 Trend (b): -0.1993 Seasonality (s): Values in the list from 1.2512 to -2.0162.These values represent the starting points for the level, trend, and seasonal components used by the model for forecasting.

#What is the value of sigma?  What does the sigma signify?
#The value of sigma is 3.0971.Sigma represents the standard deviation of the residuals (errors). It quantifies the average deviation of observed values from the fitted model values. A smaller sigma indicates a better fit.

#Separately define each forecast method and why it is useful. Show the best and worst forecast method for each of the accuracy measures.

#Naive Forecast: This method assumes the next value in the time series is equal to the last observed value. It's useful when there is no obvious trend or seasonality.

#SES (Simple Exponential Smoothing): This method applies exponentially decreasing weights to past observations. It’s useful for series without a trend or seasonal components but where the most recent observations are more important.

#Holt-Winters (HW) Forecast: This method extends exponential smoothing by accounting for both trend and seasonality in the data. It's useful when your time series shows both trends and seasonal patterns.

#ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average): ARIMA is a more sophisticated model that fits a time series by combining autoregressive (AR) terms, differencing (I) to make the series stationary, and moving averages (MA). It's useful for series that may have complex, non-linear patterns, including trend and seasonality.
