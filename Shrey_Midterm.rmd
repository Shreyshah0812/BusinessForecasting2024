#Is the time series seasonal? 
#ANS:  YES Time series is seasonal

#Is the decomposition additive or multiplicative?
# ANS:  The decomposition seems to be additive. Because, with as trend increases, we do not see any increase in the seasonality. The seasonality appears to be the same throughout.

#Can you think of the reason behind the high and low values in those months? 
 
#For high value there may chance it is spring season so there are more chances of people getting affected by the allgereis so because of that there are more sales in health product. For summer season there may be chances of getting the dehydrated so thats why chances of sales increases. In winters there is so much cold so thats why there is increase in sales of health products

#For low values there are chances that doctors are on vacation and there may be no such flu or some thing

#The graph shows that sales go up and down a lot depending on the time of year. The red line shows what the sales would look like if there weren't any seasonal changes. When the black line is far from the red line, it means that seasonality is having a big impact on sales at that time.

#conclusion
#The data seemed to have trend and seasonality
#Based on the three forecasting methods naive, simple smoothing, and HoltWinters, we can see that HoltWinters forecast provides to be the better forecasting method in this case
#This is because the forecast fits perfectly and also the error values are quiet low for HoltWinters forecast.
#Based on the analysis and forecast, the time series will decrease over the next year and the next 2 years.
